# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, here, I tried to predict the final price of each home.

 Results which I achieved with the train test Split.
 MAE :0.01
 RMSE : 0.14
 VAR :0.91
 
 I am a beginner in Data Science and I would love to have some feedbacks. Thank You :)
